## Overview
This document describes a system architecture designed to provide configurable services to multiple partners, each serving different types of end-users. Partners operate in isolated user spaces with customizable functionality and permissions. The system also incorporates user state transitions and associated limitations.

## Architecture Components

### 1. **Core Modules**
- **Partner Management Service**: This service configures partner-specific settings, including accessible services, permissions, and user roles.
- **User Management Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, role transitions, and session management.
- **KYC Service**: Verifies user identity, enabling status transitions (e.g., "guest" → "basic").
- **Limits and Policies Engine**: Enforces session and operation limits based on user roles and system rules.
- **Operation Tracking Service**: Tracks user actions to ensure compliance with defined limits and policies.

### 2. **Data Storage**
- **Partner Configuration Database**: Stores partner-specific settings, including functionality access and user role definitions.
- **User Data Repository**: Manages user profiles, role states, and KYC status.
- **Operational Logs**: Maintains logs of user activities for limit enforcement and auditing.

### 3. **API Gateway**
It provides a unified interface for partners and users to access system services and implements authentication, authorization, and request routing.

### 4. **Session Manager**
Manages user sessions, including time tracking, idle state handling, and session termination.

### 5. **Role Transition Logic**
Implements state transitions for user roles, based on predefined rules:
- "guest" → "basic" → "advanced"
- "advanced" → "basic" → "guest"
- "company" ↔ "advanced"

## Key Features

### Partner Isolation
- User sets for different partners are strictly segregated.
- Functionalities and permissions are individually configurable per partner.

### User Roles
- **guest**: Limited to 20-minute sessions, 5 daily operations, and 20 operations in 7 days. Exceeds these limits → transitions to "idle".
- **basic**: Extended limits to 20 daily operations and 50 in 7 days.
- **company** and **advanced**: No operational or session limits.

### Transition Rules
- Status transitions depend on user actions and partner-specific configurations.
